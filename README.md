# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. 
Employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. 
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.
Use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
