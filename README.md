# Credit_Risk_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:
Apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.

Employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.

Use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.
